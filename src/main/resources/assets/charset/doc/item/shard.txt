Our scientists have arrived at a breakthrough discovery! Instead of making punched glass disappear into the void,
we have been able to materialize a significant fraction of it in the form of shards! Simply craft four in a 2x2 box
to get your beloved glass blocks back!

This can also be used to turn panes back into glass, although not losslessly!
