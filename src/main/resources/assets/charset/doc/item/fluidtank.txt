Fluid Tanks can store up to 16 buckets of a single liquid - say, water or lava - per block.
They do, however, stack vertically - for example, a tower of four Fluid Tanks can store up to 64 buckets total.

Right clicking a tank with a fluid container will insert the fluid you're holding into the tank,
and left clicking will try to move the fluid inside the tank into the held container.

Fluid Tanks can be made out of Glass or Stained Glass. Tanks of different glass types do not connect to each other.
