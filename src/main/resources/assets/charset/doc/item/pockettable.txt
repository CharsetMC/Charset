The Pocket Crafting Table is a compact, portable version of the Crafting Table. However,
in order to achieve an effective volume of \i{nothing}, some compromises had to be made -
notably, it uses the 3x3 rightmost slots of your inventory to perform the crafting!

In exchange, however, it provides useful functionality:

\- The clear button can be used to clear the Pocket Crafting Table's crafting area.
\- The swirl button can be used to move items around in the clockwise direction.
\- The balance button can be used to equalize the stack sizes between slots with matching items.
