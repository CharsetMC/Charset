The Key is your primary - and only - way to open containers locked using the
\url{mod://charset/item/lock}{Lock}.

If you're scared of losing your key, you can duplicate them! If you, instead,
fear forgetting which key is which, you can dye them. As for the tedium of
carrying multiple keys, the \url{mod://charset/item/keyring}{Keyring} might
be able to help you there.
