The Keyring lets you hold up to nine keys in one place!
\checkmods{all}{baubles}{It}{If you have Baubles installed, it} can also serve as a bauble
and open \url{mod://charset/item/lock}{Lock}s without you having to hold it explicitly!

For those of you who enjoy color-coding, keep in mind that it will not only list the keys'
colors on its tooltip, it will also show the color of the three leftmost keys on its icon!
