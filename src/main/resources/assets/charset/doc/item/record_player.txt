Record Players can be used to record and play back audio.

They may be operated in one of two ways:

\- In-world - right-click the top to insert the disc and adjust the playback head, sneak-right-click to eject the disc,
\- GUI - sneak-right-click one of the side faces. The GUI provides additional recording functionality not available
through in-world operation.
