The Compression Crafter is a powerful crafting machine.

It crafts using barrels. It is built like a ring, with an inside area ranging from 3x3 to 1x1.
The individual Crafters must face inwards. It can be built flat or vertically.

It is activated with a redstone signal. There must be an inventory for the results of crafting to be output to on the
side being powered by the signal.

The top of the crafting grid is defined by the top of the barrels.
