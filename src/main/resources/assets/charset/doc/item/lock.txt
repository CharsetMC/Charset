\scale{2}{\item{charset:lock}} \title{Lock}

The Lock can be used to lock containers. It is crafted based on a specific
\url{mod://charset/item/key}{Key}, and only that Key - or a duplicate - may
be used to open it.

In order to apply a Lock on a container, simply sneak-right-click it. The container
will now not be openable without holding a matching Key or \url{mod://charset/item/keyring}{Keyring}.
To remove the Lock, simply left-click it!
