Chests can store up to 27 different stacks of items.

Right-clicking on a chest opens its inventory, in which
you can manage the items.

Chests can be made out of any wood type available.

Chests will connect to a surrounding chest of the same material to create a double
chest, which stores 54 stacks of items. You can control this
by placing the chest while sneaking; placing it on the ground
will always create a single chest, whereas placing it on the face
of an existing chest will always create a double chest.

Machines can extract from and insert to any side of the chest.

You can, additionally, use a wrench to connect and disconnect chests from each
other. To do so, right-click a suitable chest with one.
