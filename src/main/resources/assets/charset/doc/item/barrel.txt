\scale{2}{\item{charset:barrel}{1}{32767}} \title{The Barrel}

Barrels can store up to 64 stacks of a single item.
So, a single barrel can store 4096 sticks,
64 swords, or 1024 eggs.

Right clicking a barrel will store what you're holding,
and left clicking removes a stack.
Shift left clicking will remove a single item.
Double right-clicking will fill the barrel
from your inventory.

Barrels can have any direction and orientation.
Clicking near the side edge of a block will place the barrel
with its top pointing to that side.

Machines can only extract from the bottom of the barrel.
Insertion is done from the top, or the back.

\header{Upgrades}

There are a few upgrades for the standard barrel.

\item{minecraft:hopper} \item{slimeball}

The hopping upgrade will pull one item from its above into it,
and push one item out its bottom, at the same speed as a
vanilla hopper.
It also hops.
A direct redstone signal will disable it.

The sticky upgrade ensures that the first item put into the barrel gets stuck to the slime, and must be removed manually.

Those of you in creative mode may find special \i{infinite} barrels. They will never run out of their item!

In addition, you can craft any barrel with a minecart to create a Barrel Cart! \item{charset:barrelcart}{1}{32767}
