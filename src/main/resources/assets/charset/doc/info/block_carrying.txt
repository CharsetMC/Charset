\title{Block Carrying}

Have you ever wished you didn't have to demolish half of your base just to move your machines three blocks to the right?
Well, here's the solution - \i{Block Carrying}! Simply sneak-middle-click a nearby block to try it!

Beware though, as some challenges do apply:

\- You cannot sprint while carrying blocks - they're quite heavy! A Strength potion or two might help, though.
\- If you fall from a great height, it's pretty likely you'll drop your block somewhere nearby.
\- Mob Spawners are enchanted with a hidden power which won't easily bend to your will. Be careful!

There's also some neat tricks you can do, however:

\- Try sneak-middle-clicking a minecart with a chest - or a chest \i{into} a minecart!
