# Support

The mod is currently not being actively maintained, albeit severe issues may be fixed from time to time. Nonetheless, for documentation, please report issues on 
the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CharsetMC/Charset/issues) - future maintainers and/or other users may find them handy.

For feature requests and discussion, I highly encourage you to visit #charset on the EsperNet IRC network. ([Webchat](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=#charset))
