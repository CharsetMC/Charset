Additions:

* [simplelogic.wires] Configuration options for all cable types.
* [simplelogic.wires] Colored Bundled Cables!
    * I don't usually add features to patch releases, but Charset's release schedule is all strange again. Sorry!

Bugs fixed:

* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#265] A lot of assorted issues relating to gate mirroring.
    * Does anyone test this mod?
* [storage.tanks] [GitHub/#278] Various issues pertaining to Charset tanks
* [tweak.carry] [GitHub/#277] Blacklist lilypads from being carried (I wish I had a better solution)

Errata:

* [GitHub/#287] MCMultiPart-contained gates cannot be mirrored with all wrenches.
    * Charset, AE2, ... wrenches do, however, work.
