Additions:

* New gate: Comparator
    * Acts like the vanilla Redstone Comparator
* New gate: Repeater
    * Acts like the vanilla Redstone Repeater.
* New module: tools.engineering!
    * New tool: Signal Meter! Lets you measure the signal strength of vanilla redstone and SimpleLogic wires.
    * New tool: Stopwatch! Lets you measure time between two block updates.

Bugs fixed:

* [lib.wires] [GitHub/#296] MCMP doesn't block vertical connection between freestanding cable and bundled cable bug
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#295] Regression in freestanding cable visibility for gates
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#294] Issues with render updates of Bundled Transceiver (may have also fixed other gates)
* [simplelogic.wires] Placing freestanding wire one block above vanilla redstone wire would power said redstone wire
* [storage.tanks] Incorrect rounding of comparator output value

Errata:

* The SimpleLogic Repeater still has tiny timing issues relative to vanilla. This will be fixed, and should not
  affect simpler builds.
