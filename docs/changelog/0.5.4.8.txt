* Consider this an "0.5.5 part 1" release. Due to the major amount of bugfixes and upcoming addon-breaking
  changes, I decided to push this early.

Additions:

* [simplelogic.gates] New gate: Comparator
    * Acts like the vanilla Redstone Comparator
* [simplelogic.gates] New gate: Timer

Bugs fixed:

* [lib] [GitHub/#309] Creative tab crash when MCMultiPart not installed; regression
* [lib] [GitHub/#303] Shift-scroll in creative mode not handling NBT-tagged items correctly
* [lib.wires] [GitHub/#296] MCMP doesn't block vertical connection between freestanding cable and bundled cable bug
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#308] Freestanding bundled cables connecting to gates in certain situations
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#298] Modeling and texturing accuracy issues in certain gates
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#295] Regression in freestanding cable visibility for gates
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#294] Issues with render updates of Bundled Transceiver (may have also fixed other gates)
* [simplelogic.wires] Placing freestanding wire one block above vanilla redstone wire would power said redstone wire
* [storage.tanks] Incorrect rounding of comparator output value

Errata:

* [simplelogic.gates] The SimpleLogic gate still have some timing issues relative to vanilla. This will be fixed,
  and should not affect simpler/non-timing-centric builds. (To be exact, they may update too /quickly/ at times.)
  See [GitHub/#297] for more information.
