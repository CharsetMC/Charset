Additions:

* [simplelogic.gates] New gate: Comparator
    * Acts like the vanilla Redstone Comparator
* [simplelogic.gates] New gate: Repeater
    * Acts like the vanilla Redstone Repeater.
* [simplelogic.gates] New gate: Timer
* New module: tools.engineering!
    * New tool: Signal Meter! Lets you measure the signal strength of vanilla redstone and SimpleLogic wires.
    * New tool: Stopwatch! Lets you measure time between two block updates.

Bugs fixed:

* [lib.wires] [GitHub/#296] MCMP doesn't block vertical connection between freestanding cable and bundled cable bug
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#298] Modeling and texturing accuracy issues in certain gates
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#295] Regression in freestanding cable visibility for gates
* [simplelogic.gates] [GitHub/#294] Issues with render updates of Bundled Transceiver (may have also fixed other gates)
* [simplelogic.wires] Placing freestanding wire one block above vanilla redstone wire would power said redstone wire
* [storage.tanks] Incorrect rounding of comparator output value

Errata:

* [simplelogic.gates] The SimpleLogic gate still have some timing issues relative to vanilla. This will be fixed,
  and should not affect simpler/non-timing-centric builds. (To be exact, they may update too /quickly/ at times.)
