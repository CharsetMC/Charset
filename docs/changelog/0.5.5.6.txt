Additions:

* [lib] Reworked Charset developer commands.
    * /ch at is now merged with /ch hand as follows:
        * "/ch hand" is now an alias for "/ch at item".
        * "/ch at block" is used to look up information on a block.
        * "/ch at self" is used to look up information on the caller's entity.
    * The command alone will print general information (ID, basic statistics, etc.)
    * The "class" sub-command can be used to look up the class hierarchy of a given in-game object.
    * Sub-commands for item-based options include "material" (Charset material registry) and "ore" (Forge ore dict).
    * Where applicable, "tag" can be used to print the NBT tag.
    * Tab completion support has been added.
* [tweak.rightClickHarvest] [GitHub/#355] Nether Wart support.

Bugs fixed:

* [transport.dyeableMinecarts] [GitHub/#353] Incompatibility with other mods' expectations regarding model override
