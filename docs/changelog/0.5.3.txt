* [lib] InfraRedstone compatibility: all comparator-supporting blocks will return more detailed information via InfraRedstone's Encoder.
* [crafting.pocket] JustEnoughItems recipe transfer compatibility.
* [simplelogic.*] Options to force TESR rendering on heavily updating parts. Note - no caching is being done on them yet!

* [storage.chests] Chests now output comparator values.
* [storage.chests] Inventory Tweaks compatibility.

Bugs fixed:
